# shiny-google-analytics
The main purpose of this project was to develop a shiny application to have a tool that could
help advertisers using statistics techinques to better understand their metrics.
Since R is a statistical language, with the shiny package we can deploy applications and at the same time
use the huge resources in the statistical field that R currently has, instead of developing an application
from scratch with the common full stack programming lanaguages.
